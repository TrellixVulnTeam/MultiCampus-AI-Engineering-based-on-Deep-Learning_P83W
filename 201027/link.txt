After preventing President Obama from filling a vacancy four years ago, Republicans moved swiftly to deliver President Trump a victory days before the election. Both presidential candidates campaigned in Pennsylvania, where Joe Biden said he would expand his electoral map and Mr. Trump mocked Kamala Harris.
